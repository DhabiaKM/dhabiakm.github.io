        <h2> Behind the Project </h2>
        <h3 >  We are two creepypasta narrators, sister and brother. Our names are Rose and Joscelyn. We are both living in a boring wasteland town called Bright Falls, named for the town's official landmark - a water tower that shoots down from the mountain above and hangs there, a few hundred feet up, like a big winged soda can. While most people have something stupid to do with their life -- get a job, go to school, find a relationship, etc., we two are content with only giving you one episode every month. This means you get an intriguing story with a high.
        <br><br>
Call us anything you want: friend, parent, worst enemy, or walking abortion machine. We're also doing some seriously weird shit with magical games, more on that soon For now, we are content producing our own stories, but if you would like to hear more of our work you can follow our channels on Twitter and check out our subreddit!
