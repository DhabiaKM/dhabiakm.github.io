One of the most intriguing people I have met is Duplessis Jere, he is what we would call a priest. He is a philosopher who specialises in indigenous religions and dreams, as well as the nature of evil and in trying to communicate with spirits and energy.
<br><br>
He has achieved cult status in Alis because of his relationship with the spirit, Achuta, who had been associated with a traditional shaman and warrior called Wande N'Diaye. While I was talking to Jere in his house, a group of drummers from a nearby village assembled on a rug laid on the ground in the clearance in front of the door, followed by a group of dancers.
<br><br>
There was a lot of shouting and singing, and when it was all over, Wande N'Diaye turned up with three village boys whom he was giving drum lessons to. Then he appeared to the young men from the village and started to conduct a traditional initiation ceremony involving the caning of them. I was struck by how quickly and openly everything was done.


<br><br>
Jere told me the initiation process was one of the reasons why his relationship with N'Diaye had ended.
