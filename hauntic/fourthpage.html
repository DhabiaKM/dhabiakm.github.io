Entry #4: Bright Roads Ahead </h2>
        <p > 

06:00AM: We finally reached the end of the river, and we saw it, the town, the castle, the walls and the villages. All the countries were built on top of each other, and they looked like interlocking plates on a scale model of an atom. The walls of each town were built into the walls of its neighbors, and every one of those walled cities was identical. The town we had been passing by since we left the river had to be one of them.

<br><br>
I felt like the town was holding its breath, waiting to be filled with life. It was really hard not to put my hand on the hilt of my sword and storming down the road.
<br><br>
07:00AM: the valley. I had always dreamed of reaching this point, but it was even more beautiful than I had ever imagined. The rock walls were dark and mysterious, and the blue river, so tranquil and so beautiful. I thought to myself, “We are in the town of fear, but where should we be going now?”
<br><br>
08:00AM: I stood there confused for a second, until I remembered that I had this list of places to explore and places to go to, and I remembered where we had reached before.

09:00AM: the people. I was so happy when I saw it. I didn't want to leave until I had seen it. I went inside the castle and saw a feast being prepared, and I wanted to know more, and I talked to a king there. He told me that the king had beheaded him, but that he had his daughter, Saska. When she saw me, she ran to me, and we went to the castle town.
<br>
What did she say?
<br>
Not knowing what to say, I asked what she wanted.
<br>
"Nothing," she said, "I just wanted to go home."
<br>
But she wanted to stay with me.
<br><br>
10:00PM: at the stone bridge. The only thing that worried me was that we were in town and not at the castle. I felt afraid for some reason, and I got a bad feeling about the surroundings. So, I went up to the guard, and asked him if there were any places that I might stay in the town. His answer was always the same “Welcome to Groesbaai, your stay has to be in town”. I never really liked staying in town, and it seems like nobody else wanted to either.
