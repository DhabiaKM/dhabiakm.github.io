        <h2> November 1st <br>
Entry #9: Things are Not Making Sense, We are not okay. </h2>
        <p > 

Tell our mother we love her. Things are not making sense. The nights are long, there are no more bright moments, no more fun. Dullness, we don't feel alive. The dark is getting darker.  Days are getting worse. We were placed in a cave that we can't get out of. We are locked in a room without an exit, our only hope to survive is to somehow make it outside and back home. It was a trap. There are no exits, we can't see a thing, no light. All we can see is darkness.
<br><br>
Please, tell our mother that we love her.
