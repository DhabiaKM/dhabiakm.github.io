Entry #3: The Animals of Alis </h2>
        <p > 
08:00PM: We have been here for almost 19 days, we have seen no sign of civilization yet. 
Today we came across more than one kind of animal. The one that struck me the most was strange, nothing like any animal back on Earth, it had claws, scaly looking skin, we tried to communicate but there was no response. I could feel the creature, see its insides, as it moved and we went near it, I could hear what it was saying, that its time here had come to an end and it had to leave now. I could feel the creature make the last few movements of its life, there was a ripple on its stomach, as it inhaled, exhaled, it sighed, I could see it laying down, then it was gone, another ghostly figure in the form of a great animal gone.
<br><br>

09:00PM: Another animal also had claws on its legs, not like a bear but more like a feline. This feline did not have a tail, it actually resembled a monkey, and it seemed it was very attached to a deceased mother according to Jocelyn who said she sensed it. I got out of the boat to try to help the monkey, but then it climbed onto Jocelyn’s chest and tried to bite her as if it wanted to kill her. We thought it was going to. I got wounded mildly on my chest. The monkey creature ran off as soon as it heard us start to scream. It was about 2 meters long and looked very exotic and at the same time very strange. We shot pictures and took video but it ran away so quickly that we did not catch up to it.
<br><br>
10:00PM: We did see one that looked like a bear, a tail like a cat and legs like a duck. I know what you are thinking, no we are not going to upload a video. Four legs, fur like back and had a mane that extended from the neck to the back.
<br><br>

11:00PM: Today Jocelyn said we reached the location of the sun. What does that mean? Is the journey nearly over? Have we reached what we came for? Will we ever reach this distant planet? We reached the edge of the sun, I will explain what this means in due time.
<br><br>

12:00PM: We were making our way down a hill when we found a hole in the ground. A river of water that was probably about 2 meters deep appeared in the bottom and as we went down the river made its way over our heads and I kept going. Maybe civilization? Hopefully civilization. We made camp for the night. Tomorrow we head towards the river’s source.
